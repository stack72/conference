CodeMash
--
A conference in an indoor waterpark in Ohio in the Winter. Speaking here about Vagrant and it's uses to help developers and operations staff with understanding how to deploy their systems into production.

More information can be found on their [site](http://codemash.org/)

DevDay
--
This was my absolute favourite conference of 2013. A small conference in Krakow, Poland. It's completely free and is very well organised. If you want to go to a developer conference in Europe in 2014 then this is definitely one to go to.
