CodeMash
--
A conference in an indoor waterpark in Ohio in the Winter. Speaking here about Vagrant and it's uses to help developers and operations staff with understanding how to deploy their systems into production.

More information can be found on their [site](http://codemash.org/)

WarmCroc
--
A developer conference in Copenhagen. This year they have an incredible line up of speakers. It's not a huge conference at all but is certainly a conference worth looking into. $100 of every ticket gets donated to Medecins Sans Frontieres. I shall be speaking about [Vagrant](http://thewcdc.net/conf/session/27) here

DevDay
--
This was my absolute favourite conference of 2013. A small conference in Krakow, Poland. It's completely free, has great speakers, a great social scene to it and is very well organised. If you want to go to a developer conference in Europe in 2014 then this is definitely one to go to.
