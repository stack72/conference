CodeMash

A conference in an indoor waterpark in Ohio in the Winter. Speaking here about Vagrant and it's uses to help developers and operations staff with understanding how to deploy their systems into production.

WarmCroc
--
Copenhagen, Denmark: 15 - 16 January [Speaking]

This year they have an incredible line up of speakers. It's not a huge conference at all but is certainly a conference worth looking into. $100 of every ticket gets donated to Medecins Sans Frontieres. I shall be speaking about [Vagrant](http://thewcdc.net/conf/session/27) here

Krakow, Poland: 27 - 29th March.

Student event in Poland. I will be coupling with event with a speaking engagement in Wroclow on 27th March.

CraftConf
--
Budapest, Hungary: 23 - 25th April [Attending]

This looks to be one of the best lined up conferences of the year for me even though it is completely new. It has a real good mix of deveoper and DevOps tracks. I shall definitely be looking to go to this

PuppetConf

DevDay
--
Krakow, Poland: 26th September

This was my absolute favourite conference of 2013. A small conference.. It's completely free, has great speakers, a great social scene to it and is very well organised. If you want to go to a developer conference in Europe in 2014 then this is definitely one to go to.
